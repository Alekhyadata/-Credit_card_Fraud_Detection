# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection  

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using data analytics and machine learning techniques.  
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards, where each record is labeled as fraudulent or genuine.  

### 🧠 Objective  
To build a model that accurately identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.  

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

### 🔍 Key Steps  
1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
2. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE and undersampling techniques  
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover fraud patterns  
4. Model building and hyperparameter tuning  
5. Evaluating model performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  

### 📈 Results  
- Achieved over **99% accuracy** on training data and **excellent recall** for fraud detection  
- Improved fraud identification rate using resampling and tuning  

### 💬 Insights  
- Fraud transactions have distinct feature distributions compared to normal ones  
- Imbalanced data heavily impacts model precision — handled using SMOTE
